 # Let's get fancy
 It's now time for the **finishing touches**.
 ## Wait, that's you?
 Up until now, you were able to hide *your gorgeous appearance* behind an avatar. Well, now, let's add a real image in Swift's `UIImage` format:
 */
//#-hidden-code
import UIKit
import PlaygroundSupport
//#-end-hidden-code
// Instantiate an UIImage object with a picture of you (Tap the image litaral to select or snap one)
let profileImage: UIImage = /*#-editable-code your image*/#imageLiteral(resourceName: "Placeholder")/*#-end-editable-code*/
// Update the live view's ProfileImageView and provide it with your profileImage object
updateProfileImageView(withImage: profileImage)
/*:
 ## So many hues!
 Color is identity and tells the world a lot about what your brand, or in this case you yourself stand for. If you wish to, you can now customize your card's background. Under the hood, this is backed by a `CAGradientLayer`. Choose from one of the following `Gradient` color combinations:
 - `.orangeYellow`
 - `.pinkPurple`
 - `.deepBlue`
 - `.brightGreen`
 - `.bloodyMary`
 */
// Instantiate a Gradient object of your choice in short notation (.yourGradient)
let cardViewGradient: Gradient = /*#-editable-code your gradient, e.g. .deepBlue*/.orangeYellow/*#-end-editable-code*/
// Apply it to your CardView
updateCardViewLayer(toGradient: cardViewGradient)
/*:
 ## Accessibility
 Technology is the *ultimate equalizer*, which means that your digital card will be understood by everyone, including those with bad eyesight. By calling this function, your personal card gains a VoiceOver button powered by `AVFoundation`:
 */
// Import Apple's AVFoundation framework
import AVFoundation
// Create a readable version of your card and enable the VoiceOver button
prepareForVoiceOver()
/*:
 ## It looks so real!
 Finally, let's preview your card in the real world. Thanks to Apple's `ARKit` and `SceneKit`, you can now bring your digital card into the real world and experience it visually as if it were printed. By calling this function, your personal card gains an AR button:
 */
// Import Apple's ARKit and SceneKit frameworks
import ARKit
import SceneKit
// Configure ARKit and enable the AR button
prepareForARKit()
//: When you're ready, hit "Run My Code" to see the result.

PlaygroundPage.current.assessmentStatus = .pass(message: "### Wow! \nClose this prompt and try out your creation! Tap on your VoiceOver and AR buttons to experience your finished card. *For the grand finale, let's finish up with the [**last page**](@next)*")

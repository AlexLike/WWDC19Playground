 # Nice to meet you!
 Now that you're done, let me introduce myself the "Build your personal CARD" way:
 */
// Load Alex' card onto LiveView
loadAlexCard()
/*:
 When you're ready, hit "Run My Code" to see the result.
 * Note:
 This card has some neat surprises:
   - Call me by tapping the phone `ActionView`
   - Swipe it to the right side of the `LiveView`
 *
 Thank you so much for making my Playground your own!
 Hope to see you soon at WWDC19!
